# Spring-2019-Hackathon-Entry
The theme of this Hackathon competition was to utilise hardware, either Arduino or Google Home/Echo dot, to improve an existing process or just make something better. We decided to create an automated car crash notification system that senses when a driver has gotten into an accident and notifies the authorities as soon as possible. This makes it easier on 911 dispatchers who are given a location, and cuts out critical time between the accident, and the arrival of first responders.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
Arduino Uno Board
Accelerometer
Arduino IDE
Python 3
Node.js
```

### Installing

Clone the repository from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/JBobda/Spring-Hackathon-2019.git
```
Upload the arduino files to the arduino uno, start the node server, which is connected to the arduino, and run they python script.

## Algorithms

```javascript
// code away!

let generateProject = project => {
  let code = [];
  for (let js = 0; js < project.length; js++) {
    code.push(js);
  }
};
